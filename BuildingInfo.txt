The Golden Bones Installer is almost entirely coded in NSIS.
The main gbInstaller nsi file needs to be compiled by NSIS. (MakeNSISW)
Additionally, a few plugins are required for compilation:
 - inetc
 - nsJSON

If you've cloned this repository and installed NSIS with the required plugins,
building should be as simple as selecting the nsi file to compile with NSIS.
